<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Leyla Kudrat, a passionate coder and project 
  enthusiast. From the moment I started tinkering with code, I knew I had found my calling. 
  There's something incredibly satisfying about bringing ideas to life through lines of code.
</p>

<p>
  I believe in the power of creativity and innovation, and I'm constantly exploring new technologies and techniques to push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's crafting a sleek website, developing a useful app, or diving into the world of machine learning, I thrive on the thrill of turning concepts into reality.

  When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me indulging in my other interests, 
  which include hiking, reading, and travelling accross Europe. 
  But no matter where life takes me, coding remains at the heart of everything I do.

  This website is a showcase of my projects, a place where I can share my passion 
  for coding and connect with fellow enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned developer 
  or just starting out, I hope you'll find 
  inspiration here and join me on this exciting journey of exploration and discovery.
